                    <br>
                    <p class="map-description">A duck's life is a masterclass in adaptability and efficiency, from its highly waterproof feathers that keep the downy underlayer next to its skin completely dry, to its webbed feet that act as powerful paddles in the water. These birds, closely related to swans and geese but smaller in stature, are found in freshwater and seawater environments across the globe, except for Antarctica. They are incredibly social and feel most at ease in large groups, often huddling together at night for protection, with vigilant members taking turns to watch for predators. Their diet is omnivorous and diverse, consisting of aquatic plants, insects, seeds, fruit, fish, and other small animals, all strained through a comb-like structure in their bill called a pecten. While the female mallard produces the iconic "quack" sound, most other species communicate through whistles, cooing, yodels, and grunts, showcasing a range of vocalizations as varied as their global habitats.</p>
